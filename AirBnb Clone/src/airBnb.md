# Scrimba - AirBnb Clone 

The Airbnb clone is a great tool that helps pratice ReactJs. In this process, we learned how to use React Props, Creating components with an Array, whilst using Mapping components. This mostly highlights static images and lists of experience that is created through the use of an Array.

## Initialize Project
This project was initialized using 
To deploy this project run

```bash
  npm create vite@latest
```

## Components
Below are 3 comoponets that add to the static potrayal of the webpage.

 - Navbar
 - Hero
 - Card

 ### Navbar
The Navbar component consists of the AirBnb logo, and styled with box-shadow, flexbox and fun interesting ways. 

 ### Hero
- This component is similar to the stylistic and layout of the Navbar   Component. This time we have a photo-grid.png image, that ties  the whole page layout, with and <h1> and <p>
- Within the webpage, there is Poppins font that add a clean and legible experience for the user and the developers alike

 ### Card
- The Card component is the most dynamic component out of the whole page, as it helps with practicing some intricate concepts.
- Concepts that include props, map() and rendering 
#### Props
- Props help with the resusability of the component. This is reflective throughtout the usage of the Card component, as this component is the most vital component. It carries the main information out of the whole page. The process of outworking this card component has been simpliefied by the method of the card component.

#### Map
- The map displays the list of similar objects of a component without manually typing out every arrayed element.
- This function was mainly used in the App.js file, where the data.js information was stored. Map assists iterate over an array and modify its elements using a callback function. Since the data.js file carried an arrayed object of information.
- The map helps even simiplify the number of props in the card array, which in turn help us render the information in render functon  

This project has really helped me understand and some Javascript content in a more practical and appliable way
